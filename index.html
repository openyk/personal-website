				<h2 class="m-t-50">Thinking Outside Our Window of History</h2>

				<p>Only a few generations ago, slavery and serfdom were considered normal. What do we consider normal today that will be looked back in disgust by future generations?</p>

				<p>People tend to ignore serious problems until they themselves get seriously hurt. People tend to accept the status quo for as long as they themselves live in relative comfort.</p>

				<h2 class="m-t-50">Problems Of Our Time</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Climate Change (tipping points, feedback loops, global inertia, forced migration, natural disasters, agricultural disruption,
						infrastructure degradation)</li>
					<li>Scalping and Price-Gouging of Basic Necessities</li>
					<li>Decreasing Energy-Return-On-Energy-Investment (EROEI)</li>
					<li>Strategic Resource Management and Next-Gen Recycling</li>
					<li>Patent Trolling and Regulatory Capture</li>
					<li>Resource-based Geopolitical Conflicts</li>
					<li>Science-Economy Disconnect (why countries can suffer greatly and die despite having a skilled population that is willing to work and physically capable of collective
						survival)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I applaud current efforts for clean energy and automotive/industrial electrification.</p>

				<p>Whoever was part of planning the <a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/global-innovation-clusters/en">Global Innovation Clusters</a> in Canada did a really good job.</p>

				<h2 class="m-t-50">About Me</h2>

				<p>Childhood: Born in 1993, moved to Canada with my parents and little sister in 2000. Good memories playing Yugioh; learning about card valuation and fair trades. Hundreds of hours
					dropped off at Chapters to read game/hobby books (this is how I got into chess and combat robotics). I used to be a super-committed Runescape miner, then got scammed when trying to
					sell 1M gp worth of coal (I cried).</p>

				<p>Adolescence: Started hobby robotics. Learned mechatronics through early internet resources and applied engineering books. Appreciated the community pioneering of Jim Smenstowski
					(Team Nightmare) and robust designs of Carlo Bertocchini (Biohazard robot). Fond memories of Super Smash Bros Melee at a friend's house regularly after school.</p>

				<p>Adulthood: Empathy matured. Systems engineering interest expanded to economics. Hobby technnical enthusiasm evolved to passion for real product development with
					free-information/open-source/modular-compatibility/DIY-friendly ideals. Over 10 years of technical experience, major 1st hand frustrations with so many bad products/designs out
					there (all the way from when I was 14, my new fishing rod broke on the first cast) that they really compelled me to design and build things properly! Tired of non-constructive
					office politics, getting effective communication is a relief. I like the principles of being kind yet firm, push-up focused systems (instead of pull-down), bridging abstract ideals
					to specific experiences, and discovering the good truths that move you forward.</p>

				<h2 class="m-t-50">About this Website</h2>

				<p>The value of a personal website seems limited because it is temporary (dies with the person), niche
					value (fragments of the person's ideas), and harder to search for (than finding profiles on typical
					social platforms).</p>

				<p>That said, they create opportunities for interested people to efficiently learn about a person at a
					deeper level, passively building rapport and natural unity.</p>
