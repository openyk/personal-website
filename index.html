<h2 class="m-t-50">About this Website</h2>

<p>The value of a personal website seems limited because it is temporary (dies with the person), niche value (fragments of the person's ideas), and harder to search for (than finding profiles on typical social platforms).</p>

<p>That said, they create opportunities for interested people to efficiently learn about a person at a deeper level, passively building rapport and natural unity.</p>
