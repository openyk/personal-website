<p class="m-t-50">Welcome. I'm Yoonseo Kang. This is my personal website. Here you can learn more about me and how I understand the world. The best way to contact me is email.</p>

<h2 class="m-t-50">About this Website</h2>



<p>Personal websites are limited for long-term knowledge-sharing because they are temporary (dies with the person), niche value (fragments of one person's ideas), and hard to naturally find (unless the content is high SEO or the person is specifically searched for).</p>

<p>That said, they create opportunities for interested people to passively explore and build rapport with like-minded individuals (beyond the professional curtain of typical public-profile platforms). Personal websites can build natural unity at the individual level.</p>

<h2 class="m-t-50">About Me</h2>

<p>Born 1993, South Korea. Early historical role model, Korean National Hero Admiral Yi Sun-Sin; inventor of the turtle ship, undefeated naval commander, prevented total annihilation of Korea with desperate 13 vs 133 warship victory. Real world consequences of strategic and technological preparation aligned with competence and determination.</p>

<p>Year 2000, moved to Canada. Fresh air, spacious geography, pro-freedom constitution, and high-quality supply chain shared with the United States. Great place for a long-term base.</p>

<p>Year 2006, started hobby robotics. Deep mechatronic study with early internet textwalls and applied engineering books. Appreciated the community pioneering of Jim Smenstowski (Team Nightmare). Inspired by the robust designs of Carlo Bertocchini (Biohazard robot). Led high school robotics team thru annual SkillsCanada competitions.</p>

<p>Year 2010, empathy matures; everyone's well-being matters. Systems engineering interest expands to economics. Technical hobby enthusiasm evolves to passion for real product development with open-source ideals.</p>

<p>Now, year 2020 and beyond. Over 8 years of professional experience across mechanical, electrical, and software development. General engineer, Peter Thiel fellow, open source advocate (with sensible limits), knowledge theorist, humanist utilitarian.</p>

<p>I value:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Truth, Efficiency, Real World Consequences.</li>
	<li>Freedom, Opportunity, Fairness, bridging the gap between Abstract Ideals and Specific Experiences.</li>
	<li>Goodness, Competence, Determination.</li>
	<li>Comprehensive Safety. I enjoy analyzing case studies, ex. reports provided by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/USCSB">USCSB</a>.</li>
	<li>Lasting Reliability of Core Functionality. I like the design principles of websites like <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">this</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I aspire for technical excellence, racing with the ghost of a perfect engineer; knowing well that ability largely determines success or failure.</p>

<p>I want to help advance the world technology tree and build great systems that work, survive, and do not fail anyone.</p>

<h2 class="m-t-50">Engineering</h2>
<p>What is good? Which is better? What can be done? From fundamental questions we pursue the best intersection of what is ideal and what is possible.</p>
<p>What is the design that should be produced? For every design decision, question its proximity to finality.</p>

<h2 class="m-t-50">Knowledge</h2>

<p>Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 class="m-t-50">Productivity</h2>

<p>Year, 365 days. Day, 24 hours, Healthy sleep, 8 hours average per day.</p>

<p>Every day, 0.27% of the year. Every day, 16 hours of healthy uptime.</p>

<p>Every minute, doubly useful for concurrent physical action and mental exertion.</p>

<p>Every action, gated by possibility awareness (know available actions and consequences), rational confidence (determine one action as good enough), mental discipline (actually do the best known course of action). Example, cooking alarm. It rings, you consider the state of the kitchen (awareness). You know you need to turn off the stove to prevent the food from burning (confidence). Tired or not, you walk there and turn the stove off (discipline).</p>

<h2 class="m-t-50">Experiences</h2>

<p>Time is limited. Reading and watching speed is limited. Budgeting time for consuming info is unavoidable.</p>
